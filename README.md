# X-Ray Bone Fracture Detection App

## Project Overview

This project is an advanced machine learning application designed to detect bone fractures in X-ray images with milisecond response time. It utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and deep learning models to analyze X-ray images and identify potential fractures, serving as a diagnostic aid for medical professionals.

### Key Features

- YOLOv8l model for bone fracture detection
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing X-ray images
- Real-time fracture detection and visualization 
- Comprehensive performance metrics adhering to medical imaging standards
- Designed as a SaaS prototype for potential clinical integration

## Dataset

The model was trained on the [Bone Fracture Detection Computer Vision Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/bone-fracture-detection-computer-vision-project) from Kaggle. This dataset contains a diverse collection of X-ray images with labeled bone fractures, allowing for robust model training and evaluation.

## Project Structure

1. **App v1.0**: Full aplication
2. **Archive-x-ray**: 4K x-ray image dataset
3. **Testing-images**: Script to test the model on it's own with test images
4. **YOLOv8l_quick_run**: YOLOv8l model with documentation about the model when tested
5. **MODEL.md**: https://github.com/DimitriVavoulisPortfolio/x-ray-bone-fracture-detection-app/blob/main/MODEL.md
6. **PROCESS.md**: https://github.com/DimitriVavoulisPortfolio/x-ray-bone-fracture-detection-app/blob/main/PROCESS.md
7. **train_yolov8_bone_fracture_detector v2.0.py**: Script to make the model including sorting of the dataset
## Model Performance

The YOLOv8 model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

- mAP50: 0.37
- mAP50-95: 0.18
- Precision: 0.46
- Recall: 0.26

These metrics suggest that the model is capable of detecting bone fractures with reasonable accuracy, but there is still room for improvement. The project team is continuously working on optimizing the model's performance and exploring strategies to enhance the detection capabilities.

DISCLAIMER: This is a prototype, it's not a replacement to medical professionals and future iterations while better in quality are still not a replacement, consult a medical professional on case of injury

## Usage

1. Upload an X-ray image through the secure web interface.
2. The application processes the image and displays results with fracture probability scores.
3. Review the detection results, including highlighted regions of interest.
4. (Optional) Provide feedback to improve model performance.

## Clinical Validation

This tool is intended to assist, not replace, professional medical judgment. All results should be interpreted by qualified medical professionals in the context of clinical findings and patient history.

## Data Privacy and Security

This application adheres to strict medical data privacy standards. All uploaded images and results are encrypted and securely handled in compliance with healthcare data protection regulations.

## Future Work

- Enhanced YOLOv8l model for better bone fracture diagnosis
- Enhance the user interface for better visualization of results
- Integrate with medical record systems for seamless workflow integration
- Expand the dataset to improve model generalization across diverse populations
